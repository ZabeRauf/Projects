      <p>By going to military schools you can get a diverse education and master a variety of skill sets. Military schools provide students with the experiences and disciplines for better judgment, and self-discipline. Military School is just like High School, though with instructors that teach with a militaristic style. Most military schools still have a civilian student body along with military cadets, save for Virginia Military Institute in which the entire student body consists of cadets, and is state-sponsored. Along with that, some high schools have Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) for students to gain knowledge prior to enrolling at a college or Military Academy. Some of the colleges considered military academies are operated and funded by the Federal Government. </p>

<p>There are many benefits to attending any military school. For one, no matter the level of the school, a high quality education is of primary focus. Men and women who attend a military school will be “prepared for a life of leadership and community involvement.” Military schools help with character development to help the student become the person they want to be. Student will be valued, and learn qualities that make a good person. They will learn core values of integrity, honor, self-discipline, and service among others. While it may be difficult to adjust to the environment, students will become structured, and will become familiar to the way of life at these schools. If your child decides that any branch of the military is right for him or her, then another benefit of going to military school will help them progress further in the ranks of the military. Finally, commitment plays a big part in this. Time spent at military school will help ready the student for a life of commitments and service to their community and country.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
