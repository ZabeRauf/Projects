      <h3>Military School!</h3>
      <p>By going to military schools you can get a diverse education and master a variety of skill sets. Military schools provide students with the experiences and disciplines for better judgment, and self-discipline. Military School is just like High School, though with instructors that teach with a militaristic style. Most military schools still have a civilian student body along with military cadets, save for Virginia Military Institute in which the entire student body consists of cadets, and is state-sponsored. Along with that, some high schools have Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) for students to gain knowledge prior to enrolling at a college or Military Academy. Some of the colleges considered military academies are operated and funded by the Federal Government. </p>
  

      <p>Military schools for middle, and high school students are still just like the normal school systems though they focus on students who want to join the military and for parents who know that military school is right for their child and know that it will set them on the right path to success.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Attending Military School: </h3>

  <p>There are many benefits to attending any military school. For one, no matter the level of the school, a high quality education is of primary focus. Men and women who attend a military school will be “prepared for a life of leadership and community involvement.” Military schools help with character development to help the student become the person they want to be. Student will be valued, and learn qualities that make a good person. They will learn core values of integrity, honor, self-discipline, and service among others. While it may be difficult to adjust to the environment, students will become structured, and will become familiar to the way of life at these schools. If your child decides that any branch of the military is right for him or her, then another benefit of going to military school will help them progress further in the ranks of the military. Finally, commitment plays a big part in this. Time spent at military school will help ready the student for a life of commitments and service to their community and country.</p>

<h3>Skills Developed in Military School:</h3>

<p>On top of self-discipline and better judgement, they also develop responsibility, leadership skills that will benefit the student in college, and countless years after. Most schools value teamwork, and interpersonal skills to enlighten students to be proper men and women for the future. Timing and organization is one of the important skills also applied to the education received at military schools, and academies. As noted by Hargrave Military School’s website, there is no simple path, a military environment requires determination and strength. Also, students can go for different areas of training even if they won’t specialize with it while in military academies, or as a full soldier for a certain branch in the military. For example, a student could go to an airborne school for training. </p>

<p>The work given at military schools help students cope with working under pressure, and prioritize work to meet deadlines. By prioritizing, which is an excellent way to complete specific tasks, students put the most recently acquired task to be done by a certain date, and are able to spend an equal amount of time and effort into assignments given by different classes at the school. </p>

<p>All military schools have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. This is an effective way to ensure that your son/daughter will not try to do drugs, as it could end their time at these schools. It is to also teach students the consequences of getting involved with drugs. Mostly this is to help students develop a sense of self-control. Trust is built to the point where students can be given security clearance for trainings and facilities. Students are expected to learn how to be flexible in their line of work, and be able to adapt to rapid changes.</p>

<p>All of these skill sets and practices help develop a stronger character for each student. The focused toward enabling trust, honor, integrity, and strength. These characteristics benefit each other, the units, and the country. To enforce this, military schools develop Honor Codes, these Honor Codes are regarded highly, and any violation is met with severe punishment such as harsh physical activity, or detention. It could also tarnish the cadet’s reputation and standing with their peers.</p>

<h4>Navy Specialties:</h4>
<p>There are schools supported by and connected to different branches of the military. For example, the United States Naval Academy located in Annapolis, Maryland. The academic programs in Naval Academies are focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). “Graduates who are proficient in scientific inquiry, logical reasoning and problem solving will provide an officer corps ready to lead in each warfare community of the Navy and Marine Corps.” Some student will do special trainings offered by Naval Academies or scholar programs, for instance Nuclear Navy. Some will also decide to do extensive research on topic such as; Nuclear Power, Oxidizer Injection, and Hybrid Rocket Motor Systems.</p>

Marine officers programs are allowed to those enlisted Marines who show determination and are qualified to become an officer. Usually, they will be sent to further their education, and work with and talk to their chain of command to become an officer.  </p>

<h3>Unique Military Education:</h3>

<p>These areas of military trainings and studies are mostly available in military academies which put a student through rigorous levels of college education. They are designed to still give students the knowledge to excel in different branches of the military, helps prepare the student for the real world of military training and work. Though, in common, each branch still will push students to excel beyond their best. They still favor students who are in need of assistance or are willing to put in effort to work in certain areas of the military. This says that even though the student is not motivated enough, they will be molded and improved to become better individuals. </p>

<a href='http://afs.sagepub.com/content/20/3/473.short'>http://afs.sagepub.com/content/20/3/473.short </a>

<p>Military academies/schools challenge their cadets and provide them with the best education possible, whilst providing a social intense environment with experiences that influence their value systems. At some academies, especially at Coast Guard Academies administer a Survey of Personal Values and the Survey of Interpersonal Values to students during their freshman and senior years at the academies to document significant changes in the student’s values. “These results are discussed in terms of the general effect of a college experience versus the unique education at a military academy. The overall conclusion is that military academy experience may be less a process of inculcating new and different values than of reinforcing the institutionally compatible values of those who voluntarily choose the military profession.” IT is also noted that students mature faster in a military academy rather than a “normal” college environment. Because of the maturation, students experience a change in attitudes, values, or behavior.” Military academies monitor socialization at times where rewards and sanctions are lavishly used to encourage appropriate behavior. Stevens also notes that even medical students had attended military academies and were trained and most had showed that experiences had helped further their growth.  (Stevens, 2015, pp. 474-480) </p>

<p>Culture and Discipline in Military Academies brings to attention possible developments with regard to the military profession and the bureaucratic character of military organizations. (1998, vol. 26, no2, pp. 169-189 (1 p.1/4) of Culture and Discipline in Military Academies) </p>

<h3>Synopsis:</h3>

<p>Sending your child to military school would benefit them by teaching them skills, and disciplining them to make better choices to prevent them from making horrible decisions that may jeopardize their future. Parents should also help contribute to building certain skills, such as trust. As an example of military style used to build trust; I had a friend whose parents tried to build trust in their daughter by placing a GPS tracker in her phone, her parents installed it in her phone at the Verizon store and kept track of where she went for 5 years. During our tenth grade year in high school, her parents took her phone and removed the GPS chip in front of her and told her what it was for.</p>

<h3>Wes Moore</h3>
<p>Another example of a man who attended military school, and because of this experience he became the better man he is today, is Wes Moore author of The Other Wes Moore. In this story of his life, he explains about his hardships growing up and about his counterpart, another man named Wes Moore who was in prison for murder. Wes says that just like his counterpart, he became involved with gangs in his neighborhood. Wes, as a young teen, was constantly getting in trouble at school, and with his parents. It went on until Wes’ mother became extremely fed up with his behavior and sent him to military school. Wes attended Valley Forge Military School, and graduated from there in 1998 and was commissioned officer. It was Wes’ experience in military school that “led him to join the Army and sparked a lifelong commitment to service.” Wes stated, “My original decision to join the Army was almost entirely shaped by the people around me when I was in military school.” While in military school, Wes also notes that he saw values like honor, trust, and respect manifested in the people around him. Seeing the leadership, and honor among his friends and senior officers at military school got him to push himself to be something better and to make his life mean something. </p>

<p>When asked why he thought military school would be important for young Americans to serve, Wes replied, “I believe it is important for all Americans to serve because of the incredible benefits that service yields. Service positively impacts communities and helps to enhance and improve our cities nationwide. It's fair to say that service benefits many different people, but it benefits those performing the service most. Every service experience is an opportunity to learn and develop one's passions and skills in a way that a formal, rigid professional environment can't offer. Service allows one to explore their most meaningful impact every day.” (Wes Moore) </p>
