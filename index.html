      <h3>Military School!</h3>
      <p>By going to military schools you can get a diverse education and master a variety of skill sets. Military schools provide students with the experiences and disciplines for better judgment, and self-discipline. Military School is just like High School, though with instructors that teach with a militaristic style. Most military schools still have a civilian student body along with military cadets, save for Virginia Military Institute in which the entire student body consists of cadets, and is state-sponsored. Along with that, some high schools have Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) for students to gain knowledge prior to enrolling at a college or Military Academy. Some of the colleges considered military academies are operated and funded by the Federal Government. </p>

<h3>Benefits of Attending Military School: </h3>

<p>There are many benefits to attending any military school. For one, no matter the level of the school, a high quality education is of primary focus. Men and women who attend a military school will be “prepared for a life of leadership and community involvement.” Military schools help with character development to help the student become the person they want to be. Student will be valued, and learn qualities that make a good person. They will learn core values of integrity, honor, self-discipline, and service among others. While it may be difficult to adjust to the environment, students will become structured, and will become familiar to the way of life at these schools. If your child decides that any branch of the military is right for him or her, then another benefit of going to military school will help them progress further in the ranks of the military. Finally, commitment plays a big part in this. Time spent at military school will help ready the student for a life of commitments and service to their community and country.</p>

<h3>Skills Developed in Military School:</h3>

<p>On top of self-discipline and better judgement, they also develop responsibility, leadership skills that will benefit the student in college, and countless years after. Most schools value teamwork, and interpersonal skills to enlighten students to be proper men and women for the future. Timing and organization is one of the important skills also applied to the education received at military schools, and academies. As noted by Hargrave Military School’s website, there is no simple path, a military environment requires determination and strength. Also, students can go for different areas of training even if they won’t specialize with it while in military academies, or as a full soldier for a certain branch in the military. For example, a student could go to an airborne school for training. </p>

<p>The work given at military schools help students cope with working under pressure, and prioritize work to meet deadlines. By prioritizing, which is an excellent way to complete specific tasks, students put the most recently acquired task to be done by a certain date, and are able to spend an equal amount of time and effort into assignments given by different classes at the school. </p>

<p>All military schools have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. This is an effective way to ensure that your son/daughter will not try to do drugs, as it could end their time at these schools. It is to also teach students the consequences of getting involved with drugs. Mostly this is to help students develop a sense of self-control. Trust is built to the point where students can be given security clearance for trainings and facilities. Students are expected to learn how to be flexible in their line of work, and be able to adapt to rapid changes.</p>

<p>All of these skill sets and practices help develop a stronger character for each student. The focused toward enabling trust, honor, integrity, and strength. These characteristics benefit each other, the units, and the country. To enforce this, military schools develop Honor Codes, these Honor Codes are regarded highly, and any violation is met with severe punishment such as harsh physical activity, or detention. It could also tarnish the cadet’s reputation and standing with their peers.</p>
